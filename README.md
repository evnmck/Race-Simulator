# Race-Simulator

I was working on a project with some friends and we need someway to keep track of two times and determine which was quicker. I found this idea interesting and created a
java program which took a number of player objects, each with time and name fields, computed the difference in their times and sorted/ordered them based on their times.
I recently updated this program to also count the number of ties and print the names of the players who tied, as well as the winner.
